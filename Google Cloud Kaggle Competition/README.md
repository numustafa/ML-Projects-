In this project, I will be using my skills in Data Analysis and concepts of Machine Learning to develop a predictive model, that predicts the taxi fare for a ride in NYC. I am using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction) by Google Cloud.

## Description
In this playground competition, hosted in partnership with Google Cloud and Coursera, you are tasked with predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations. While you can get a basic estimate based on just the distance between the two points, this will result in an RMSE of $5-$8, depending on the model used (see the starter code for an example of this approach in Kernels). Your challenge is to do better than this using Machine Learning techniques!

## Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this competition is the root mean-squared error or RMSE. RMSE measures the difference between the predictions of a model, and the corresponding ground truth. A large RMSE is equivalent to a large average error, so smaller values of RMSE are better. One nice property of RMSE is that the error is given in the units being measured, so you can tell very directly how incorrect the model might be on unseen data.
